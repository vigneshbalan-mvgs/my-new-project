React Native Mobile App Documentation
Overview

This documentation outlines the requirements and steps for setting up the development environment for your React Native mobile app. It includes system requirements, dependencies, and instructions for configuring Android and iOS emulators.
Prerequisites

1. Operating System

   Windows 10/11: For Android development.
   MacOS: For both Android and iOS development.
   Linux: For Android development.

2. Node.js

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from Node.js official website. 3. React Native CLI

Install the React Native CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli

```

4. Java Development Kit (JDK)

   JDK 11 or above is required for Android development. You can download it from Oracle's website.

5. Android Studio

For Android development, you need Android Studio installed. It includes the Android SDK, emulators, and build tools.

    Download from Android Studio website.

After installation:

    Open Android Studio.
    Go to SDK Manager and install the necessary SDK versions and system images.
    Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) for emulation.

6. Xcode (macOS Only)

For iOS development, you need Xcode installed. Xcode includes the iOS SDK and iOS simulator.

    Download from the Mac App Store.

After installation:

    Open Xcode.
    Install the required components from Preferences > Components.
    Set up an iOS simulator from Xcode > Preferences > Devices.

System Requirements
Minimum System Requirements:

    Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent.
    RAM: 8 GB.
    Storage: 20 GB available disk space.
    Graphics: Integrated GPU for basic emulation, dedicated GPU for faster performance.

Recommended System Requirements:

    Processor: Intel Core i7 or Apple M1/M2 (for macOS).
    RAM: 16 GB or higher.
    Storage: SSD with at least 50 GB available space.
    Graphics: Dedicated GPU (NVIDIA/AMD) for faster Android emulation.

Development Setup

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
cd repository

```

2. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install

```

3. Android Emulator Setup

   Launch Android Studio and start the AVD Manager.
   Create or start an Android Virtual Device (emulator).
   Make sure the emulator is running before running your app.

4. iOS Simulator Setup (macOS Only)

   Open Xcode and start an iOS Simulator from Xcode > Preferences > Devices.
   Ensure the simulator is running before executing your app.

5. Running the App

For Android:

```bash
npx react-native run-android

```

For iOS (macOS only):

```bash
npx react-native run-ios

```

Additional Requirements

1. IDE/Editor

   Visual Studio Code: Recommended editor for React Native development. You can download it from VS Code website.

2. Other Tools

   Watchman: A file-watching service required by React Native. Install it via Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
brew install watchman

```

    CocoaPods: Required for iOS dependencies. Install it via Homebrew (macOS):

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods

```

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

    Emulator not starting: Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements and that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS settings (for Windows).
    Build errors: Check that all dependencies are installed correctly, and paths are set up properly in the environment variables.
    Slow emulator performance: Increase RAM allocation for the emulator or switch to a physical device for testing.

Conclusion

This guide should help you set up the development environment for your React Native mobile app. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out via the project's issue tracker.
